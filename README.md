# Operations at PAE and MWH Airports üõ©Ô∏èüåé

## About

A Python-based application utilizing Streamlit to provide structured, interactive visualizations on the operations (take-offs and landings) at PAE and MWH airports.

The Python implementation is available at <https://github.com/steffen-coe/Airport-Operations>. It is available under an [MIT License](LICENSE).

<> Data is taken from the FAA's Operations Network (OPSNET), available at <https://aspm.faa.gov/opsnet/sys/Airport.asp>.

Data is taken from the following sources:
+ [FAA's Operations Network (OPSNET)](https://aspm.faa.gov/opsnet/sys/Airport.asp), reporting counts of airport operations as recorded by the Air Traffic Activity System (ATADS)
  * Can be aggregated by day, month, or year
+ [FAA's Terminal Area Forecast (TAF)](https://taf.faa.gov/), representing official FAA forecasts of aviation activity (see also [here](https://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation/taf))
  * Only available by year

## Usage

The application can be found under <https://share.streamlit.io/steffen-coe/airport-operations/main/app.py>.

The application was written in the Python programming language (version 3.8), using the [Streamlit interface](https://streamlit.io/) to produce an interactive user interface with tables and visuals.


## Pages (`src/*`)

The code for the individual pages in the Streamlit app is contained in the files the `src/` folder. Within each of these files, when the radio button in the app's sidebar is activated for the respective page, the `write()` function is called and executed, printing the page content in the app.
